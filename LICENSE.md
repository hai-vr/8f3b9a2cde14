Due to the parallel project subsets in this project, a different LICENSE file is
attached to each subset subdirectory, but not all of them have a license attached yet.

This is organized in this way to avoid issues when dealing with code inside subsets that comes from other projects,
such as interaction with the Steam API.

**The LICENSE file of each subdirectory only apply to the files contained within that subdirectory.**

The following subdirectories are under a separate MIT License each:
